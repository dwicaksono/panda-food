## 📝 Description

Hey there! 🌟 Crafting seamless web experiences is my forte, and I'm currently immersed in the world of a food self-ordering app using Next.js 14, Prisma, MongoDB, Zustand, and the real-time magic of Pusher. Imagine: effortless orders, lightning-fast kitchen alerts, and customers tracking their meal's journey from "waiting" to "cooking"! I bring energy, humor, and a passion for user-centric tech. Let's whip up something incredible together! 🍔🚀
